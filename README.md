## Markdown Stickies

This project was made by loosely following a tutorial to help me learn about Web Dev  
Made with HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript  

### Features
- Allows the user to create as many sticky notes as they want
- After the user writes what they want, they can convert it to Markdown by clicking the save button
- The user can also delete any sticky notes
- All the sticky notes are saved inside the users local storage
